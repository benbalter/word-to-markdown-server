*TL;DR:* This service is provided for your convenience, without any warranty of any kind. In an ideal world, if you use common sense, it will convert your document securely and privately, and this site will try it's best, but make no guarantees whatsoever.

Like any other website, your use of this service is subject to these terms, meaning if you use the service, you agree to be bound by these terms. That also means, that if you *do not* agree with all of the terms here, you may not use the service.

Assuming, "You" are the person uploading a document to be converted (your "Content"), and "the Service" is the website you are currently on to convert your Content, specifically:

* Don't use this Service for anything illegal. Don't try to hack or overburden the Service. Don't use it to harm others.
* You may not use this Service if you are under 13 years old. Explain to your parents what Markdown is and have them use the Service on your behalf.
* The Content you upload to be converted is your Content and you are responsible for it and any harm that it may cause to yourself or others.
* The Service doesn't claim any ownership in the original Content or Markdown conversion. You, however, do claim that you have a right to possess and convert the Content. If you don't, don't use this service to convert it. If Content you upload infringes on the rights of others, that's on you.
* The Service does not review your Content nor the Content of others, nor does it endorse any Content uploaded or converted. You're responsible for ensuring the Content or converted Content doesn't harm your computer (or anyone else's).
* You use this Service at your own risk and it might break or cease to exist at any time.
* If you'd like to know how your information is used and stored, read [more about your privacy](/privacy/).

**This Service is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. In no event shall the owners, maintainers, or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in action of tort, contract, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the service or its use.**
